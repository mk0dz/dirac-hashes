# Tools for Dirac Hashes

This directory contains utility tools and scripts for the Dirac Hashes project.

## Contents

- `benchmark.py`: Script for benchmarking the performance of different hash functions and signature schemes
- `demo.py`: Interactive demonstration of the Dirac Hashes capabilities

## Usage

### Benchmark

Run the benchmark tool to compare the performance of different hash algorithms and signature schemes:

```bash
python tools/benchmark.py
```

Results will be stored in the `benchmark_results` directory.

### Demo

Run the interactive demo to see Dirac Hashes in action:

```bash
python tools/demo.py
```

This will provide an interactive demonstration of the quantum-resistant hash functions and signature schemes.
