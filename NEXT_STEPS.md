## Technical Details

### Post-Quantum Signature Implementation

For the next phase, we'll focus on implementing the Lamport signature scheme, which is quantum-resistant:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Generate a pair of random bit strings for each bit in the message digest
   - Public key will be the hash of each of these values
   - Private key will be the original bit strings

2. **Signing**:
   - Hash the message using our improved quantum-inspired hash function
   - For each bit in the message digest, reveal one of the two random values from the private key
   - The signature is the collection of these revealed values

3. **Verification**:
   - Hash the message using the same hash function
   - For each bit, hash the corresponding part of the signature
   - Compare the result with the corresponding part of the public key

This approach will provide strong post-quantum security guarantees while leveraging our improved hash functions.

### Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet Design

We'll implement a hierarchical deterministic wallet using our improved hash functions:

1. **Master Key Generation**:
   - Generate a high-entropy seed using our quantum-inspired seed generation
   - Derive master private and chain code from the seed

2. **Child Key Derivation**:
   - Implement BIP32-like key derivation using our improved HMAC functions
   - Support hardened and non-hardened derivation paths

3. **Path-Based Derivation**:
   - Implement Solana-compatible derivation paths
   - Support multiple accounts and sub-accounts

### Transaction Signing

We'll implement Solana transaction signing:

1. **Transaction Serialization**:
   - Implement Solana transaction format
   - Support different instruction types

2. **Quantum-Resistant Signing**:
   - Use Lamport signatures for transaction authorization
   - Implement efficient signature encoding

3. **Multi-signature Support**:
   - Support M-of-N signature schemes
   - Implement threshold signature capabilities
