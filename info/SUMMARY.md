## Conclusion

The Dirac Hashes project has made significant progress in developing quantum-inspired cryptographic primitives with security properties comparable to industry standards. The recent fixes to the Lamport signature implementation have ensured full compatibility across all hash algorithms, which is essential for the project's next phase of blockchain integration.

The project is well-positioned to advance to the next phase, focusing on creating a full post-quantum signature scheme that can be integrated with the Solana blockchain. With continued development and testing, this library could provide a valuable alternative to traditional cryptographic approaches in a future where quantum computing threatens current algorithms.
