# Quantum-Inspired Hash Function Enhancement Plan

Before proceeding to Phase 2 (Post-Quantum Digital Signatures), we'll implement the following improvements to strengthen our quantum-inspired hash functions:

## 1. Performance Optimizations

- [x] **SIMD-Compatible Implementation**: Created optimized implementations that are compatible with SIMD but still produce identical results to the original functions
- [ ] **Cache Optimization**: Reorganize memory access patterns for improved cache efficiency
- [ ] **Reduce Branching**: Eliminate conditional logic in critical loops
- [ ] **Compiler Optimizations**: Add specialized compiler directives for performance-critical sections

## 2. Enhanced Quantum Properties

- [ ] **Superposition Modeling**: Improve the mixing function to better model quantum superposition effects
- [ ] **Entanglement Properties**: Strengthen bit interdependencies with better propagation of changes
- [ ] **Quantum Walk Structures**: Incorporate quantum walk patterns into the diffusion process

## 3. Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Variable Digest Size**: Support flexible output sizes (16-64 bytes)
- [x] **Domain Separation**: Added context-specific prefixes for different applications in the hybrid hash function
- [x] **Side-Channel Protection**: Ensured constant-time operations for sensitive data processing
- [x] **Salt Support**: Added optional salt input for strengthened pre-image resistance via the SHA-256 pre-mixing

## 4. Testing and Validation

- [x] **Correctness Tests**: Added tests to verify that optimized functions produce the same output as originals
- [x] **Performance Benchmarks**: Created benchmarks to measure performance of different implementations
- [ ] **Extended Test Vectors**: Create comprehensive test vectors for validation
- [ ] **Formal Security Analysis**: Document security properties against known attack vectors
- [ ] **Large-Scale Statistical Testing**: Run extended distribution tests with larger samples
- [ ] **NIST Test Suite**: Apply NIST statistical test suite for randomness

## 5. Documentation and Usability

- [ ] **Improved API Documentation**: Enhance docstrings and examples
- [ ] **Algorithmic Explanation**: Document the quantum principles behind each function
- [ ] **Performance Guidelines**: Provide guidance on algorithm selection for different use cases
- [x] **Interoperability**: Added functions for compatibility with standard cryptographic interfaces (HMAC)

## Progress Summary

We've made significant progress in our quantum-inspired hash function implementations:

1. **Correctness and Compatibility**: Our optimized implementations now produce identical results to the original implementations, ensuring backward compatibility while preparing for future optimizations.

2. **Security Enhancements**: We've already implemented several security improvements, including domain separation, side-channel resistance, and salt support.

3. **Testing Infrastructure**: We've created a testing framework to verify correctness and benchmark performance.

The current optimized implementations provide a solid foundation for further performance improvements, particularly when numba and SIMD instructions are available. The next steps will focus on:

1. Implementing true SIMD optimizations using numba's vectorization capabilities
2. Enhancing the quantum properties of our hash functions
3. Completing the documentation and testing infrastructure

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete remaining performance optimizations (#1)
2. **Week 2**: Enhanced quantum properties and security improvements (#2-3)
3. **Week 3**: Testing, validation, and documentation (#4-5)
4. **Week 4**: Review, refinement, and preparation for Phase 2

Each improvement will be benchmarked against the current implementation to quantify the enhancement in performance and security properties.
